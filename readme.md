## Readme

This is a physics exercise book that I've assembled with the collaboration of Guglielmo Lami when we were teachers assistants at the _Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment_ in Pisa.

The problem set spans all the syllabus of an Introductory Classical Physics Course except from Thermodynamics and their difficulty varies, too. 

As of today the book is in Italian but I do not exclude translating everything in English (and at the same time give it a overall polish).

Cheers!

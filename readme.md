## Readme

This is a physics exercise book that I've assembled with the collaboration of Guglielmo Lami when we were doing teachers assistants at the _Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment_ in Pisa.

The problems span all the syllabus of an Introductory Classical Physics Course except from Thermodynamics and their difficulties varies, too. 

As of today the book is in Italian but I do not exclude to translate everything in English (and at the same time give it a general polish).

You can contact me at `d.delsarto@studenti.unipi.it`.

Cheers!
